# Travelling Salesman Problem - Software Design (works on both symmetric and asymmetric data)

To execute the sotware:

1. Rename symmetric and asymmetric data files to "symmetric_data.tsp" and "asymmetric_data.txt" and put them in respective folders in the /data/ folder
2. ### Make sure in both the files dimensions are mentioned after -> "DIMENSION:" (ie, there should not be space between Dimensions and :)
3. ### Make sure in symmetric_data.tsp the coordinates are listed in the next line after "NODE_COORD_SECTION" in the format: 1 x-coord y-coord
4. ### Make sure in asymmetric_data.txt the distance matrix is listed in the next line after "EDGE_WEIGHT_SECTION"
5. Commplie HomePanel.java
6. Run HomePanel.java
7. Select Symmetric or Asymmetric data options in GUI on screen and view the results!!!
